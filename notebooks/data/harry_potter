725,29,Harry Potter,Wait a minute.
726,29,Ron Weasley,"You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the queen will take me. Then you're free to check the king."
727,29,Harry Potter,"No, Ron, no!"
728,29,Hermione Granger,What is it?
729,29,Harry Potter,He's going to sacrifice himself.
730,29,Hermione Granger,No you can't! There must be another way!
731,29,Ron Weasley,"Do you wanna stop Snape from getting that stone or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. Knight to H-3. Check"
732,29,Harry Potter,"Ron! No! Don't move! Don't forget, we're still playing. Checkmate"
733,29,Harry Potter,"Take care of Ron. Then go to the owlery, send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on."
734,29,Hermione Granger,"You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard. You really are."
735,29,Harry Potter,Not as good as you.
736,29,Hermione Granger,"Heh, me? Books and cleverness. There are more important things. Friendship and bravery. And Harry, just be careful."
737,30,Harry Potter,"Ow! You? N-no, it can't be! Snape, h-he w-was the-"
738,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"Yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to him, who would suspect, p-p-poor s-s-s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"
739,30,Harry Potter,"But that day, during the Quidditch match, Snape tried to kill me."
740,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"No dear boy, I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded, even with Snape muttering his little countercurse."
741,30,Harry Potter,Snape was trying to save me?
742,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"I knew you were a danger to me right from the off, especially after Halloween."
743,30,Harry Potter,Th-then you let the troll in!
744,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"Very good, Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running about the dungeon, he went to the third floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now, what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it?"
745,30,Voldemort,Use the boy.
746,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"Come here, Potter! Now! Tell me, what do you see? What is it? What do you see?!"
747,30,Harry Potter,I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.
748,30,Voldemort,He lies.
749,30,Quirinus Quirrell,Tell the truth!! What do you see?!
750,30,Voldemort,Let me speak to him.
751,30,Quirinus Quirrell,"Master, you are not strong enough."
752,30,Voldemort,"I have strength enough for this. Harry Potter, we meet again."
753,30,Harry Potter,Voldemort.
754,31,Voldemort,"Yes, you see what I've become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another, a mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough, lies in your pocket. Stop him! Don't be a fool. Why suffer an horrific death, when you can join me, and live."
755,31,Harry Potter,Never!
756,31,Voldemort,"Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again, together? We can bring them back. All I ask is for something in return. That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to see it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone."
757,31,Harry Potter,You liar!
758,31,Voldemort,Kill him!
759,31,Quirinus Quirrell,"Ahhh, ah ah, ahhhhhhh! What is this magic?"
760,31,Voldemort,Fool! Get the stone!
761,32,Albus Dumbledore,"Good afternoon, Harry. Tokens from your admirers?"
762,32,Harry Potter,Admirers?
763,32,Albus Dumbledore,What happened down in the dungeons beterrn you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret. So naturally the whole school knows. I see that your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs.
764,32,Harry Potter,Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
765,32,Albus Dumbledore,Fine. They're both just fine.
766,32,Harry Potter,But what happened to the Stone?
767,32,Albus Dumbledore,"Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it was best all around."
768,32,Harry Potter,"But then Flamel, he'll die, won't he?"
769,32,Albus Dumbledore,"He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die."
770,32,Harry Potter,"How is it I got the stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror and-"
771,32,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me that is saying something."
772,32,Harry Potter,"Does that mean, with the Stone gone, that is, that Voldemort can never come back?"
773,32,Albus Dumbledore,"Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin."
774,32,Harry Potter,What is it?
775,32,Albus Dumbledore,"Love, Harry, love. Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I'm afraid I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee� Mm� Alas. Earwax."
776,33,Harry Potter,"All right there, Ron?"
777,33,Ron Weasley,All right. You?
778,33,Harry Potter,All right. Hermione?
779,33,Hermione Granger,Never better.
780,33,Albus Dumbledore,"Another year, gone! And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312 points! In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points! Second, Ravenclaw, with 426 points!�And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin house!�Yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account and I have a few last minute points to award.�To Miss Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril, fifty points!�Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years, fifty points! And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house, sixty points!"
781,33,Hermione Granger,We're tied with Slytherin!
782,33,Albus Dumbledore,"And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award ten points to Neville Longbottom! Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of decoration is in order! Gryffindor wins the House Cup!"
783,34,Rubeus Hagrid,"Come on now, hurry up, you'll be late! Train's leaving. Go on. Come on, hurry up!"
784,34,Hermione Granger,"Come on, Harry."
785,34,Harry Potter,One minute.
786,34,Rubeus Hagrid,"Thought you were leaving without sayin' goodbye, did ya? This is for you. "
787,34,Harry Potter,"Thanks, Hagrid."
788,34,Rubeus Hagrid,"Go on. On with you, on with you now. Oh, now listen Harry, if that dope of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his."
789,34,Harry Potter,"But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that."
790,34,Rubeus Hagrid,"I do, but your cousin don't, do he? Eh? Hmmhmm"
791,34,Hermione Granger,"Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?"
792,34,Harry Potter,"I'm not going home, not really."
